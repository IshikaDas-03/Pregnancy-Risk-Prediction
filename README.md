# Pregnancy Risk Detection Using Machine Learning — *Kuddle & Kick*

A system that predicts **pregnancy risk levels** (Low, Mid, High) based on key medical features using various machine learning algorithms.

---

##  Project Overview

**Kuddle & Kick** helps detect early signs of pregnancy complications using medical data such as:

- Age
- Body Temperature
- Heart Rate
- Blood Pressure
- BMI
- Blood Glucose (HbA1c & Fasting)

The system uses machine learning models to classify patients into risk levels and offers instant **remedies**, **advice**, and **emergency support**.
